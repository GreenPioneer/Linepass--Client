<h1>LinePass App</h1>

<h4>LinePass is a "two sided marketplace", which allows customers to pay to skip the line at their favorite bars.  Conversely, it enables
bar owners to create a new revenue stream by charging their customers to skip the line.  It has been a fun and challenging project to build, which has really enhanced my React skills, but I also think it could potentially have real world value for business owners.</h4>
