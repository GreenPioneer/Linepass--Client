<h1>LinePass App</h1>

<h4>LinePass is a "two sided marketplace", which allows customers to pay to skip the line at their favorite bars.  Conversely, it enables
bar owners to create a new revenue stream by charging their customers to skip the line.  It was a fun project to build, but I think it
could also potentially have real world value for business owners.</h4>
